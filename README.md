# Hear Me Code Community Statement -- January 31, 2017

We reject the racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, anti-semitic, anti-muslim, anti-immigrant, white supremacist policies and rhetoric of the current Administration.

The policies this Administration is proposing will cause very real harm to people. The rhetoric this Administration uses is meant to demonize and divide communities.

Silence and inaction in the face of this is complicity and tacit approval. 

We will not be silent in the face of attempts to divide our communities and turn neighbor against neighbor. 

We will not stand idle when our communities are threatened. We are united in our commitment to initiatives that will bring forth equality, justice, and human rights. 

We believe that diversity is necessary for a vibrant, flourishing community. We are stronger together and we welcome people from all walks of life with open arms and open hearts.

In service of this, we will be partnering with local nonprofit organizations to volunteer our time and talent to the pursuit of justice.
